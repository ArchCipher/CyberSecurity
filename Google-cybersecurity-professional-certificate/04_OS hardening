# <p align="center"> SYN Flood Attack Analysis </p>

## Overview

As a part of incident response process, I was provided with network traffic data of a website to analyse an attack. I examined the tcpdump output to identify the network protocols used in the compromise, documented the traffic analysis, and suggested security measures to prevent similar incidents in the future.

## Scenario

A client reported that their website, yummyrecipesforme.com, which sells recipes and cookbooks, was inaccessible. Users were being prompted to download a file which, when executed, redirected them to another website.

<details>
<summary><strong>Read full scenario</strong></summary>

You are a cybersecurity analyst for yummyrecipesforme.com, a website that sells recipes and cookbooks. A former employee has decided to lure users to a fake website with malware. 

The former employee/ hacker executed a brute force attack to gain access to the web host. They repeatedly entered several known default passwords for the administrative account until they correctly guessed the right one. After they obtained the login credentials, they were able to access the admin panel and change the website’s source code. They embedded a javascript function in the source code that prompted visitors to download and run a file upon visiting the website. After embedding the malware, the hacker changed the password to the administrative account. When customers download the file, they are redirected to a fake version of the website that contains the malware. 

Several hours after the attack, multiple customers emailed yummyrecipesforme’s helpdesk. They complained that the company’s website had prompted them to download a file to access free recipes. The customers claimed that, after running the file, the address of the website changed and their personal computers began running more slowly. 

In response to this incident, the website owner tries to log in to the admin panel but is unable to, so they reach out to the website hosting provider. You and other cybersecurity analysts are tasked with investigating this security event.

To address the incident, you create a sandbox environment to observe the suspicious website behavior. You run the network protocol analyzer tcpdump, then type in the URL for the website, yummyrecipesforme.com. As soon as the website loads, you are prompted to download an executable file to update your browser. You accept the download and allow the file to run. You then observe that your browser redirects you to a different URL, greatrecipesforme.com, which contains the malware.  

A senior analyst confirms that the website was compromised. The analyst checks the source code for the website. They notice that javascript code had been added to prompt website visitors to download an executable file. Analysis of the downloaded file found a script that redirects the visitors’ browsers from yummyrecipesforme.com to greatrecipesforme.com. 

The cybersecurity team reports that the web server was impacted by a brute force attack. The disgruntled hacker was able to guess the password easily because the admin password was still set to the default password. Additionally, there were no controls in place to prevent a brute force attack. 

Your job is to document the incident in detail, including identifying the network protocols used to establish the connection between the user and the website.  You should also recommend a security action to take to prevent brute force attacks in the future.

<summary><strong>Read tcpdump explanation provided</strong></summary>

The logs show the following process:

1. The browser initiates a DNS request: It requests the IP address of the yummyrecipesforme.com URL from the DNS server.

2. The DNS replies with the correct IP address. 

3. The browser initiates an HTTP request: It requests the yummyrecipesforme.com webpage using the IP address sent by the DNS server.

4. The browser initiates the download of the malware.

5. The browser initiates a DNS request for greatrecipesforme.com.

6. The DNS server responds with the IP address for greatrecipesforme.com.

7. The browser initiates an HTTP request to the IP address for greatrecipesforme.com.

## Security incident report

### Section 1: Identify the network protocol involved in the incident

The logs show
1. DNS query was initiated from your.machine on port 52444 to resolve the domain yummyrecipesforme.com. The DNS server returned the correct IP address (203.0.113.22) of the domain.
2. A TCP handshake  was successfully established between your.machine on port 36086 and yummyrecipesforme.com on port 80 (HTTP). 
3. A GET request was made over HTTP/1.1 to retrieve data from the website.
3. A lot of traffic on the port 80 followed, indicating content transfer, possibly including a malicious JavaScript that triggered the download.
4. After the file was executed, another DNS query was made to resolve greatrecipesforme.com. The DNS retuned with a new IP 192.0.2.17.
5. A new TCP connection was established with greatrecipesforme.com over port 80 (HTTP).

These logs indicate the use of DNS and HTTP (over TCP) as the protocols involved in the redirection of the website.

### Section 2: Document the incident

The incident occurred at 2:18 PM. 
Several customers emailed yummyrecipesforme’s helpdesk, complaining that the website prompted them to download a file in exchange for free recipes. After running the file, the website address changed, and computers began to slow down. 

The website was tested in a sandbox environment. Packet analysis confirmed that as soon as the yummyrecipesforme.com. website loads, users were prompted to download a file. When the file is downloaded, users were redirected to greatrecipesforme.com, a malicious site.
The source code had been modified to include malicious JavaScript prompting this behaviour. The downloaded file had a script that executed the redirection from yummyrecipesforme.com to greatrecipesforme.com. 

The investigation revealed the attacker gained access via brute-force attack, exploiting the default administrative password. No security controls were in place to prevent this type of attack.

The cause of the incident was a weak password and lack of brute-force protection. The attacker altered the site’s source code to inject malware and redirect users to a fake website.

### Section 3: Recommended remediation for brute force attacks

- Enforce Strict password policies including minimum length, complexity and expiration date.
- Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) or Two-Factor Authentication (2FA).
- Account lockouts or rate limiting after a defined number of failed login attempts.
- CAPTCHA or reCAPTCHA to detect and block automated login attempts.
