# <p align="center"> E-commerce Vulnerability Assessment </p>

## Project Overview

I simulated the role of a newly hired cybersecurity analyst for an e-commerce company. I conducted a vulnerability assessment, evaluated the risks of a vulnerable information system and outlined a remediation plan.

## Scenario
The company stores information on a remote database server, since many of the employees work remotely from locations all around the world. Employees of the company regularly query, or request, data from the server to find potential customers. The database has been open to the public since the company's launch three years ago.

## Vulnerability Assessment Report
20 June 2025

### System Description
The server hardware consists of a powerful CPU and 128GB of memory. It runs on
the latest version of Linux operating system and hosts a MySQL database management system.
It is configured with a stable network connection using IPv4 addresses and interacts with other
servers on the network. Security measures include SSL/TLS encrypted connections.

### Scope
The scope of this vulnerability assessment relates to the current access controls of the system.
The assessment will cover a period of three months, from March 2025 to May 2025. [NIST SP
800-30 Rev. 1](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-30r1.pdf) is used to guide the risk analysis of the information system.

### Purpose
The purpose of this vulnerability assessment is to evaluate the security posture of the company's MySQL database server that has been publicly accessible for three years.

The database server is a critical business asset containing sensitive customer information and serving as a gateway to other network servers with proprietary business data. Given its public accessibility and role as a central access point for remote employees worldwide, securing this system is essential to protect customer privacy, maintain business continuity, and prevent potential financial and reputational damage.

### Risk Assessment

| Threat source | Threat event | Likelihood | Severity | Risk |
|---------------|--------------|------------|---------|------|
| Competitor | Obtain sensitive business intelligence | 3 | 3 | 9 |
| Cybercriminals | Obtain sensitive customer information via exfiltration | 3 | 3 | 9 |
| Ransomware Groups | Encrypt database and demand ransom | 3 | 3 | 9 |
| Script Kiddies | Public database attack for practice/reputation | 3 | 2 | 6 |
| APT Groups | Long-term espionage on information systems | 2 | 3 | 6 |
| Insider Threats | Misuse of access for personal benefit | 2 | 3 | 6 |

### Approach

The risk assessment reveals critical vulnerabilities with the publicly accessible database server. With three high-risk threats (score 9) and three medium-risk threats (score 6) identified, the likelihood of a security incident is extremely high given the unrestricted public access to sensitive customer data.

External threat actors, including competitors, cybercriminals, and ransomware groups, can easily exploit this exposure to steal customer information or disrupt operations. Additionally, the public accessibility attracts opportunistic attackers like script kiddies and enables advanced persistent threats. The server's role as a gateway to other network systems amplifies the potential impact of any successful attack.

### Remediation Strategy
Implementation of authentication, authorization, and auditing mechanisms to ensure that only
authorized users access the database server. This includes using strong passwords, role-based
access controls, and multi-factor authentication to limit user privileges. Encryption of data in
motion using TLS instead of SSL. IP allow-listing to corporate offices to prevent random users from the internet from connecting to the database.

## Summary

This vulnerability assessment revealed that a security breach would cause tremendous impact to the business. To reduce risks the database server should be accessible only to authorized users.
