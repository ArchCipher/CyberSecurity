# <p align="center"> Home Business Asset Inventory & Classification </p>

## Project Overview

I simulated the role of operating a small business from my home, where I was responsible for creating an inventory of my network-connected devices and classifying them based on their importance and sensitivity to risk.

## Asset Inventory & Classification

### 1. Identify assets, characteristics and access

I identified all relevant devices connected to my home network that require monitoring and protection. For each asset, I recorded:

* Network access: How frequently the device connects to the network.

* Owner: The person responsible for the device.

* Location: Where the device is located relative to the router.

Additional notes provide further context or technical specifications where applicable. 

| | Asset | Network access | Owner | Location | Notes | Sensitivity |
|-|-------|----------------|-------|----------|-------|-------------|
|1| Network Router | Continuous | Internet service provider (ISP) | On-premises | Has a 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz connection. All devices connect to WPA3-secured 5 GHz.| Confidential |
|2| Desktop | Ocassional | Homeowner | On-premises | Contains private information, like photos. | Restricted |
|3| Guest Smartphone | Ocassional | Friend | On and Off-premises | Connects to the home network and possibly public networks. | Internal- only |
|4| External Hard Drive | Ocassional | Homeowner | On-premises | Contains private videos. | Restricted |
|5| Game console | Occasional | Homeowner | On and Off-premises | Equipped with a camera and microphone. Connects to both home network and public networks. | Internal-only |
|6| Personal Smartphone | Continuous | Homeowner | On and Off-premises | Contains sensitive private data. Connects to both home nework and public networks. | Restricted |

## 2. Classify the Sensitivity of Network Devices
Devices were categorized based on their sensitivity using the following levels:

* Restricted – Highly sensitive data; access on a strict need-to-know basis.

* Confidential – Sensitive but less critical; access limited to authorized users.

* Internal-only – Accessible only within the network or premises.

* Public – Accessible by anyone.

## Summary

Effective asset management is crucial for protecting networks against threats introduced by various devices. This project demonstrated how even a small home-based network can contain a diverse set of assets—each with different levels of sensitivity and risk exposure.

By identifying devices and assessing their sensitivity, I established priorities for protection, ensuring that the most critical assets receive the strongest safeguards.
