# Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio. This repository documents my learning journey, hands-on labs, and personal projects as I transition into cybersecurity from a background in architectural design.

## About Me

I’m a detail-oriented cybersecurity professional transitioning from a background in architectural design. I bring over five years of experience solving complex design challenges and working in cross-functional, international teams. I'm currently completing the Google Cybersecurity Certificate, with training in threat detection, SIEM tools, and incident response. My architectural work sharpened my skills in compliance, systems thinking, and conflict resolution—strengths I now apply to digital security.

I’m passionate about protecting people and infrastructure through thoughtful, security-first solutions.
