# Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio. This repository documents my learning journey, hands-on labs, and personal projects as I transition into cybersecurity from a background in architectural design.

## About Me

I'm a detail-oriented entry-level cybersecurity professional transitioning from a background in architectural design. I bring over five years of experience solving complex design challenges and working in cross-functional, international teams. I have completed the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, with comprehensive training in threat detection, SIEM tools, incident response, and security analysis. My architectural work sharpened my skills in compliance, systems thinking, and conflict resolutionâ€”strengths I now apply to digital security.

I'm passionate about building thoughtful, security-first solutions to protect users, data, and systems.
