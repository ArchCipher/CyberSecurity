# Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio. This repository documents my learning journey, hands-on labs, and personal projects as I transition into cybersecurity from a background in architectural design.

## About Me

I’m a detail-oriented entry-level cybersecurity professional transitioning from a background in architectural design. I bring over five years of experience solving complex design challenges and working in cross-functional, international teams. I'm currently pursuing the Google Cybersecurity Certificate, with training in threat detection, SIEM tools, and incident response. My architectural work sharpened my skills in compliance, systems thinking, and conflict resolution—strengths I now apply to digital security.

I’m passionate about building thoughtful, security-first solutions to protect users, data, and systems.

## Personal Practice Projects

### 1. Nmap Scan
- __Objective :__ Identify open ports, services, and OS details on a target system.
- __Tools :__ Terminal, nmap
- __What I Did :__ Performed basic, version, and OS detection scans using nmap and sudo nmap commands.
- __Outcome :__ Hands-on experience with port scanning, service enumeration, and OS fingerprinting.

### 2. tcpdump
- __Objective :__ Capturing data traffic and understand the meaning of the output including deeper understnading of TCP handshake and TCP IP model.
- __Tools :__ Terminal, tcpdump
- __What I Did :__ Captured tcpdump data to understand interfaces and traffic on each interface. Capturing data of a specific protocol, port. Understood how to capture data on specific host, source or destination IP.
- __Outcome :__ Hands-on experience with capturing tcpdump and fitering data based on interface, protocol, port etc.
