# CS50 Solutions

These are my personal solutions to the CS50 course problem sets. Posted here for portfolio purposes only. **If you are currently taking CS50, please do not copy or submit this code.**

## Problem Sets Overview

### Problem Set 1: C
- **[Mario](pset1/mario.md)**: Recreate the classic Mario pyramid using hashes
- **[Cash](pset1/cash.md)**: Implement a greedy algorithm for calculating change
- **[Credit](pset1/credit.md)**: Validate credit card numbers using Luhn's algorithm

### Problem Set 2: Arrays
- **[Scrabble](pset2/scrabble.md)**: Calculate word scores based on letter values
- **[Readability](pset2/readability.md)**: Calculate text readability using the Coleman-Liau index
- **[Caesar](pset2/caesar.md)**: Implement Caesar cipher encryption
- **[Substitution](pset2/substitution.md)**: Implement substitution cipher encryption

## Repository Structure

Each problem set (pset1, pset2, etc.) contains:
- `.c` files: my solution code
- `.md` files: explanation, problem summary, and approach

Example:
```
pset1/
├── mario.c
├── mario.md
├── cash.c
├── cash.md
├── credit.c
└── credit.md
```

### Additional Files
- **[Custom Functions](custom-functions/)**: Additional C programming examples including a custom strlen implementation

## Learning Objectives

These problem sets cover fundamental C programming concepts including:
- Variables, loops, and functions
- Arrays and strings
- Cryptography algorithms
- Text processing and analysis
- Input validation
- Text analysis (Coleman-Liau index)
- Mathematical logic (Luhn’s algorithm, greedy algorithms)

## Compilation & Usage

To compile and run any C file:
```bash
clang program_name.c -o program_name
./program_name
```
